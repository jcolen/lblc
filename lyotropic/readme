We calculate stress for multi-elastic-constant system


based on channel-MPI-multi, surface derivative calculations are updated

Sep/15/2017:
based on channel-MPI-multi-exp, add activity

Jan/25/2018:
based on channel-MPI-multi-exp-active, incorporte s3 into this version so that phi is included

Feb/26/2018:
now the system's state can be mirrored from left(right) to right(left)
add initial -421 for off-center radial droplet
add initial -433/-434/-435 for tactoid coalescence at 3 angles (0, 45, 90)
add initial -412 for single nematic tactoid
