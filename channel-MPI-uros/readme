based on channel-MPI-multi3-uros, now wall surface has different intensity absorption

on Mar/9/2017:
A_ldg has been replaced by a_ldg*(T0-Tn+T_on*T)

where a_ldg(>0) is material constant ()
T0 is the reference temperature (The room temperature, for instance)
Tn is the Nematic-Isotropic transition temperature
T_on controls whether temperature field enters the Q field calculation
T  is the temperature field (0 is the reference)

* T0-Tn is given as delT(<0) in the simulation.
